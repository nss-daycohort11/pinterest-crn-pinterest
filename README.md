# CRN-Pinterest

A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/cliffpyles/pen/OVPJay.

 A grid that is compatible with multi-height content.  

 Log in functionality is working.  If they need to register, that ability is also functioning and allows them to add themselves to the firebase database so their info is kept for future use.  

 The functionality to create a "board" is complete and along with the ability to "pin" items to the board of the users choice.  

 When the user clicks on something to save a modal pops up for user to create a board to their profile data.

 After user creates a "board" they now "pin" to their database and save for later.
